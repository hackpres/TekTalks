## Description
TekTalks is a blog site, similar to a wordpress site.

    Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

The development of TekTalks required quite a bit of managing technologies. It was a very useful exercise for me as a developer, and I can already see the benefit as I move into working with ODM's. I struggled more than expected with the routes, and because of that struggling I really believe that I understand it all just that much better.
